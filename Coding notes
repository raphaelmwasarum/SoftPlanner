Root - The Main description of the app
Children - the various components of the app.


E.g.

1. Project Tree:

		AppTreeStructurePlanner ---> InputResolution. Maps input to the components that can process the input:
										- Adding a new project
										- Editing a project
										- Deleting a project
										- Showing all saved projects
										- Adding a component node
										- Editing a component node
										- Deleting a component node
										- Opening a project
										- Showing current project tree  
										- Showing current project schedule

								---> ProjectAddition
								---> ProjectModification
								---> ProjectRemoval
								---> ProjectAccess
								---> ComponentAddition
								---> ComponentModification
								---> ComponentRemoval
								---> TreeViewer. Shows the project tree
								---> Scheduler:
										- Adds a component to the schedule
										- Edits a component's place in the schedule
										- Removes a component from the schedule
										- Shows the project coding schedule

2. Entities:

	- Project
		- Name
		- ProjectRoot_ID

	- Component
		- Name
		- Description
		- PseudoCode
		- Parent_ID


3. Services

    - ConsoleInput
	- KeyGenerator
	- DataService
		- local (local repository) (default)
		- io (input output services)
		- web (web services)
	- Factories (encapsulated creation of components inside components)
	- Communication (facilitates decoupled communication among components as an alternative to Dependency Injection)

4. Process tree. Shows all the possible sequences of tasks that a user can go through in the app.
