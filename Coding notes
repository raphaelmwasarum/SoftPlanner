										- Adding a component node
										- Editing a component node
										- Deleting a component node
										- Opening a project

										- Showing current project schedule

								---> ProjectAddition
								---> ProjectModification
								---> ProjectRemoval
								---> ProjectAccess
								---> ComponentAddition
								---> ComponentModification
								---> ComponentRemoval
								---> TreeViewer. Shows the project tree
								---> Scheduler:
										- Adds a component to the schedule
										- Edits a component's place in the schedule
										- Removes a component from the schedule
										- Shows the project coding schedule

    - ConsoleInput
	- KeyGenerator
	- DataService
		- local (local repository) (default)
		- io (input output services)
		- web (web services)
